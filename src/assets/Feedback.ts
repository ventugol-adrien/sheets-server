      "Adrien has a great understanding of our product and his attention to details is outstanding.\nHis willingness to take on challenging tasks is admirable. Example: he did an excellent job writing the code for almost sixteen Stories for the project OX 2.0 for Payroll. During the period of working on this project he showed the talent for simplifying complex problem. Example: Adrien recorded the Demo where he explained what should be done not only from Developer's perspective, but also he showed what should be verified by QA and how it should be verified.\nAdrien has great communication skills. Example: he set up the meetings to clarify the questions, to discuss the requirements and functionality of features.\nWorking on the project OX 2.0 for Payroll Adrien demonstrated exceptional leadership. Example: To meet the deadline he delegated the part of the work to the Developers of our Team,  communicated clearly regarding the tasks, shared his knowledge and gave an expertise.\nAdrien is a great team mate. He always finds the time to help other work mates with issues they have. Examples:\nAdrien helped find the reason, why Automation Test for UK Payslip failed, he helped to fix the failure. \nHe is always ready to review the code if other Developers don't have capacity or if they are on sick leave.\nAdrien helps me, who is still new at WD, to learn about different topics.\n\nI enjoy working with you, Adrien, and I admire your work ethic!",

      "Adrien joined our current team when it was part of German Payroll and has been a massive contributor ever since. As we wrap up our work for 24R1, I cannot let it pass without giving Adrien some well-deserved feedback. Throughout my time working with him, he has consistently demonstrated a high level of technical ability, getting to grips with issues quickly and always striving for excellence and attention to detail. Adrien understands the importance of breaking down issues for PM, QA and Dev colleagues. He is also an excellent communicator with an all positive mindset and works perfectly with colleagues in various teams around us. His support of the cross-team approach to OX 2.0 support just amazing. Workday is lucky to have workmates like Adrien. Thank you Adrien!",
